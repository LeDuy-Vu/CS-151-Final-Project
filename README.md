# CS-151-Final-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
For the solo final project from my Object-Oriented Design class, I implemented Tic Tac Toe with basic Java GUI and a game file save/load system. In this game, user can only play with computer (PvE). The user can choose mark and difficulty and interact with the game by clicking on a board. The system saves finished games and when requested, it loads archived games and plays each move from both sides in that game.
<br/>
The final product went through 3 stages, namely analysis, design, and implementation. Through the coding process, I applied important object-oriented design concepts and used core object-oriented language properties like encapsulation, interface type, assertion, exception, polymorphism, anonymous class, GUI, pattern, inheritance, abstract class, etc.
